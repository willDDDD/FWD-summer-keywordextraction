Step 1: Extract different topic corpus from arXiv dataset. (cs/math/phy corpus)
Step 2: Using the corpus from Step1 as the input for Autophrases, and get the result, which includes a list of important terms and their important scores.
Step 3: Using the list of important terms from Step2 as the input query for Domain-relevance measurement, choosing the certain domain to measure(cs/math/phy) and get the relevance score for each important term.
Step 4: Mix important scores and relevance scores with different coefficients, and then reorder all the terms based on the new mixing score.
Step 5: Extract terms in different levels (top1000/top5000/1000-2000/â€¦) from the result of step4 and calculate the precision rate based on the keyword list in specific fields (CS/MATH).
